# Private Storage Master

A Crimson Desert plugin that opens Private Storage, the housing chests, the
camp bins, Camp Provisions and Abyss gear storage from anywhere, in the game's
own warehouse screen, and sets each storage's size up to 1,460 slots. Built for
Crimson Desert 2.02.00.

It takes over from Private Storage Anywhere by Stevi2195 and PrivateStoragePlus
2.0 by jkiip. It was written from scratch and contains no code from either; see
[THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

## Antivirus

A scanner or two may flag the plugin, because the shape of what it does looks
like a trainer to a model: it is a DLL loaded into the game that searches the
game's code for byte patterns, writes jumps over five of its functions, swaps
the game's XInput import for a filter and reads the keyboard and pad first. It
imports only kernel32 and user32, so there is no network code in it, it touches
no registry key, game file or save, and every line is here to read or build
yourself.
