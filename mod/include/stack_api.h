/* Item stack sizes, the interface any mod that raises them exports.
 *
 * The same header ships with Private Storage Master and with Master Stack, and
 * both export exactly these names. A caller in the game process (Master
 * Looter's Stacks tab) finds a provider by looking for each module it knows
 * with GetModuleHandleW, then GetProcAddress on the functions below:
 *
 *     MasterStack.asi              the standalone mod
 *     PrivateStorageMaster.asi     the same feature inside the storage mod
 *
 * More than one may answer. Ask each for its status and edit the one whose
 * `applying` is 1: that is the mod actually changing the limits. Master Stack
 * takes precedence by design, so when it is installed Private Storage Master
 * reports applying 0 and leaves stacks alone. If nothing reports applying 1 the
 * feature is off everywhere, and StackApplyMultiplier on any provider that
 * answers turns it on from the next launch.
 *
 * Check StackApiVersion() first and use nothing if it differs from
 * STACK_API_VERSION. Every struct starts with its own size; set it before
 * passing one in. Fields are only ever appended, never reordered or removed, so
 * a caller built against an older header stays a prefix of a newer provider's
 * struct: the provider fills what fits, sets `size` to how many bytes it wrote,
 * and a caller checks that against the offset of any field it wants to read. A
 * size smaller than the first published layout is refused with 0.
 *
 * Plain C, no allocation across the boundary, strings copied into the caller's
 * buffers. Everything is safe to call from any thread, every frame.
