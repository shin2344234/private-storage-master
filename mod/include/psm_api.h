/* Private Storage Master, in-process interface.
 *
 * Another plugin in the game process (Master Looter's Storage tab) finds
 * PrivateStorageMaster.asi with GetModuleHandleW and each function below with
 * GetProcAddress. Check PsmApiVersion() first and use nothing if it differs
 * from PSM_API_VERSION. Every struct starts with its own size; set it before
 * passing one in, and a call with a size it does not know returns 0.
 *
 * Plain C, no allocation across the boundary, strings copied into the
 * caller's buffers. Everything is safe to call from any thread, every frame.
