## Crimson Desert 2.00 compatibility release

Tested on Crimson Desert 2.00: all six panels opened and closed, both capacity behaviors were confirmed, and no crash or freeze occurred.

### Fixed

- Replaced three stale game addresses that caused the 1.18.2 build to crash on 2.00.
- Restored the early exit that makes `PrivateStorageSlots=0` safe while still allowing a previously changed value to be restored.
- Updated the mode-state layout for Crimson Desert 2.00.
- Corrected mode and sub-mode detection to use offsets `+0x28` and `+0x29`.
- Changed the patcher to derive game-side targets from executable structure rather than typed addresses.

### Added

- Deterministic build output for the tested 2.00 executable.
- Independent layout derivation and validation tools.
- Build-time ambiguity checks that stop instead of emitting an unsafe ASI.
- A guarded diagnostic probe for refused storage opens.
- Validation of hook bytes, section layout, exception data, stack arithmetic, field offsets, vararg marshalling, stale addresses, and memory writes.

### Capacity behavior

- F5–F9 housing chests remain fixed at 1,000 slots.
- F4 Private Storage is separately configurable with `PrivateStorageSlots`.
- `PrivateStorageSlots=0` restores/defaults to normal game capacity.
- `PrivateStorageSlots=1000` sets the total to exactly 1,000, including purchased expansions.

### Diagnostic build history

- **AT:** resolved moved addresses but read the wrong mode offset, producing safe `BLOCKED` results.
- **AU:** attempted a broad pointer search; it was unsafe, withdrawn, and never reused.
- **AV:** used guarded fixed candidates safely, but its secondary log labels were incorrect; retracted as diagnostic evidence.
- **AW:** captured the exact mode object passed by the game and proved the object route was already correct.
- **AX:** corrected the mode/sub-mode offsets. Five bytes differed from AW; this became the tested final release.
